Good to see that we can create a file using cat command
cat > (file-name).

To exit from this use ctrl+d But don't use cat to edit any files, if you use cat, empty file will replace the existing files.

Good Luck

WOW!
we can't edit,  but can add data to the existing file using,
cat >> (existing file)
